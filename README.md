By Roman Vakhrushev

The code for the project: implementation, images, measurements, and Flower102 dataset is available in Comp_Stat_Proj.ipynb file.

The dataset for LastFM dataset is stored separately as zip.

The final report is available as a PDF.

The code with some early trials/legacy code (mostly for myself) is also available in the Comp_Stat_Proj_OLD.ipynb file.
